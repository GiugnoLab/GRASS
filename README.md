The subgraph isomorphism problem is a computational task that applies to a wide range of todayâ€™s applications,
ranging from the understanding of biological networks to the
analysis of social networks. Even though different implementations for CPUs have been proposed to improve the efficiency
of such a graph search algorithm, they have shown to be
bounded by the intrinsic sequential nature of the algorithm.
More recently, graphics processing units (GPUs) have become
widespread platforms that provide massive parallelism at low
cost. Nevertheless, parallelizing any efficient and optimized
sequential algorithm for subgraph isomorphism on many-core
architectures is a very challenging task. This article presents
GRASS, a parallel implementation of the subgraph isomorphism
algorithm for GPUs. Different strategies are implemented in
GRASS to deal with the space complexity of the graph searching
algorithm, the potential workload imbalance, and the thread
divergence involved by the non-homogeneity of actual graphs.
The paper presents the results obtained on several graphs of
different sizes and characteristics to understand the efficiency of
the proposed approach.
